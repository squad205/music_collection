An app for storing and searching a personal music collection geared towards owners of physical media, and finding targeted recommendations for new music.  Search will be able to be completed using a standard keyword search, that will include personalized tags applied to songs and albums by the user.  The app will also provide new music recommendations, which will be provided by comparing the keywords searched to artist provided tags obtained via web scraped data from Bandcamp, and recommendation results will include direct links to the appropriate Bandcamp page where the user can both listen to and purchase the recommendations.


The app is currently being designed around FastAPI, Postgres, and React.js, but this is subject to change as the project is refined during the planning stages.
